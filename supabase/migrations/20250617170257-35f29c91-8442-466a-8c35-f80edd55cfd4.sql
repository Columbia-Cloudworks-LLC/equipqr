-- COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY FIX: Complete RLS Policy Reconstruction
-- This migration addresses infinite recursion, missing policies, and security vulnerabilities

-- Step 1: Complete policy cleanup (remove ALL existing policies)

-- Step 2: Drop conflicting security definer functions

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.check_user_team_access(uuid, uuid) CASCADE;

-- Keep the working functions that don't cause recursion
-- These functions are already defined and working correctly:
-- - public.get_user_org_role_direct(uuid, uuid)
-- - public.check_org_access_direct(uuid, uuid)
-- - public.get_user_org_role_secure(uuid, uuid)
-- - public.check_org_access_secure(uuid, uuid)
-- - public.check_org_admin_secure(uuid, uuid)
-- - public.check_team_access_secure(uuid, uuid)
-- - public.check_team_role_secure(uuid, uuid, text)
